## I'm starting the AWS Networking Series!

## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about designing, building, and managing secure Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS from scratch. This covers core networking fundamentals and key VPC components like subnets, traffic flow, security measures, resource connectivity, VPC peering, monitoring, and service integration.

By the end of the 9 projects, I will have built a complete and secure VPC architecture, gained hands-on experience with diverse network configurations and security practices, and produced 9 pieces of portfolio-ready documentation to showcase these cloud networking skills.

I'm learning about cloud networking because I aim to add valuable AWS networking expertise to my resume, as VPC knowledge is highly sought after, and I want to confidently set up secure, efficient private cloud networks for real-world projects. 

Businesses traditionally had to build, manage, and finance their own extensive physical network infrastructure. This involved significant upfront investment in expensive hardware like servers, routers, and cables, securing and maintaining physical data centers, hiring specialized IT staff for ongoing operations and troubleshooting, planning for peak capacity, and regularly refreshing aging equipment.

Cloud networking changed things by abstracting away all that physical complexity and offering network resources as a virtualized, on-demand service, much like using a shared public postal system instead of each company running its own private mail delivery. With cloud networking, providers like AWS own and manage all the underlying physical hardware and data centers. Businesses can then rapidly provision and configure their private network environments (like VPCs) through software, paying only for the data transfer and resources they actually consume.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 1 to 2 hours every week to work on this networking series. I will keep myself accountable by scheduling these study blocks in my calendar like important appointments and aiming to complete one of the 9 projects each week, perhaps even sharing my progress or questions with the NextWork community for encouragement. My reward is mastering these crucial AWS networking concepts, successfully building a complete VPC architecture from scratch, having 9 impressive pieces of documentation for my portfolio.

### What are networks?

Computer networks are systems designed to connect computers and other devices, allowing them to communicate and share information with each other.When you send data across a network—whether it's an email, a webpage, or a video stream—that data is typically broken down into smaller pieces called data packets. These packets travel across the network, often through various paths using cables or wireless signals, and are then reassembled at their destination. To ensure these packets reach the correct device, every device on a network has a unique identifier called an IP address, which functions like a postal address. The movement of these data packets between IP addresses is referred to as network traffic. Essentially, networks provide the infrastructure and rules for these data packets to move reliably between devices.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud, which serves as your own private, logically isolated section within the broader AWS network, similar to having a dedicated operational area within a large postal service. Within this private network, you gain granular control over how network traffic flows to and from the AWS resources you launch inside it.

This helps organizations by allowing them to meticulously design and enforce their network security and architecture according to their specific needs. For instance, by carefully setting up their VPC, companies can precisely determine who can access their applications, bolster the security of their customer data, define how their different internal services communicate with each other (often without exposing them to the public internet), control whether and how their applications connect to the internet, and manage the overall traffic flow between various parts of their systems.
