## I'm exploring AWS Databases!

## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I'm learning about the diverse range of database solutions offered by AWS, including how they function, their primary use cases, and best practices for their deployment and management. I'll explore concepts like data modeling, scalability, security, and how to choose the right database for different application needs.

By the end of these projects, I will have gained hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and interacting with various AWS database services. I will have the practical skills to select appropriate database solutions for real-world scenarios and understand how to manage data effectively within the AWS cloud ecosystem.

I'm learning about cloud databases because I want to understand how modern companies store and manage critical data, add valuable AWS database expertise to my skillset for career development, and be equipped to choose and implement the optimal AWS database services for my own projects and data challenges.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

I will set aside dedicated time blocks, specifically 2-3 hours on every weekday evenings and a 4-hour block on Saturdays, to work on these database projects. I will keep myself accountable by setting a target completion date for each of the five projects, marking them on my calendar, and sharing my progress with a friend who is also learning tech skills. My reward for completing this AWS Databases series will be updating my professional resume and LinkedIn profile with these new AWS database skills, and then treating myself to a nice dinner out to celebrate the accomplishment.

### What are databases?

Databases are organized digital systems designed to efficiently store, manage, retrieve, and secure large volumes of crucial information for various applications and business operations. They act as centralized repositories, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and accessibility while preventing issues like duplication, conflicts, and information silos common with older data management methods.

Cloud engineers use databases to design, deploy, and maintain scalable, secure, and highly available data storage solutions that form the backbone of modern applications. They enable organizations to reliably manage critical data—supporting everything from e-commerce transactions (like Amazon's order processing) and financial systems (like banks ensuring balance accuracy) to content delivery (like Netflix's recommendation engine) and healthcare records—by leveraging and optimizing powerful cloud database services.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals are responsible for designing appropriate data models, creating and configuring various types of databases tailored to specific needs, which includes managing storage, performance settings, and robust security measures like network configurations, access controls, and encryption. They also write efficient queries (using SQL or NoSQL) to retrieve and manipulate data, connect databases to applications and visualization tools, and load or transform data.

The most interesting part of their job is the ability to focus on strategic, high-value tasks like optimizing how data is organized and accessed, ensuring its security, and enabling applications to derive meaningful insights and functionality from that data, rather than being bogged down by the complexities of managing physical hardware and routine maintenance. They get to directly contribute to "making the most out of data" for an organization.
